                    All content on our website was created with the greatest care and to the best of
                    our knowledge. However, we cannot guarantee that the content is correct, complete or
                    up-to-date. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these
                    pages in accordance with general laws in accordance with Section 7 Paragraph 1 TMG. However,
                    according to Sections 8 to 10 TMG, as a service provider we are not obliged to monitor
                    transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that
                    indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in
                    accordance with general law remain unaffected.

                <p className="text-lg">However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time
                    we become aware of a specific legal violation. If we become aware of the above-mentioned
                    legal violations, we will immediately remove this content.

                <p className="text-lg">
                    Our website contains links to external third-party websites. We have no influence
                    on the content of these directly or indirectly linked websites. We therefore cannot
                    assume any liability for the accuracy of the content of “external links”. The respective
                    providers or operators (authors) of the pages are responsible for the content of the
                    external links.

                <p className="text-lg">
                    The external links were checked for possible legal violations at the time the link was
                    created and were free of illegal content at the time the link was created. A constant
                    check of the content of external links is not possible without concrete evidence of a
                    legal violation. In the case of direct or indirect links to third-party websites that
                    are outside our area of ​​responsibility, liability would only exist if we became aware
                    of the content and it would be technically possible and reasonable for us to prevent
                    use in the event of illegal content .
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">This disclaimer of liability also applies to links and references
                    from questioners, blog entries and guests of the discussion forum within the “name of
